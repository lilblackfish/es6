//default values are mostly used if you need to export a single value or function or object from module
//mudoles can have only one default value so you can use any name to reference it during import
 

//app.js

let sum = () => a+b;

export default sum

//index.js
import * as variables from './app';
import addition from './app';

//If you are using * to import values then you have to use alias (i.e) names that will refer to imported values
//Using * to import values doesnâ€™t import default value. You have to import it separately.

//If you need to import default value and other values in a single line, you can use the above syntax.
import addition, * as variables from './app'
